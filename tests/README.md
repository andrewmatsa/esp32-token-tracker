# Web UI + HTTP API tests (Playwright)

End-to-end tests for the token-tracker dashboard and its REST API
(`GET /state`, `POST /command`, `/wifi/info`, static files). The **same specs**
run in two modes:

- **mock** (default) — a Node mock of the ESP32 (`mock-device.js`) is started
  automatically; no hardware needed. Ideal for CI and quick local runs.
- **device** — runs against the real device over the network, with automatic
  snapshot + restore of its agent state.

> This is separate from `../test/`, which is PlatformIO's C unit-test directory.

## Setup

```bash
cd tests
npm install
npm run install-browsers   # one-time: downloads the Chromium Playwright uses
```

## Run — mock mode (no hardware)

```bash
npm test              # runs everything against the auto-started mock
npm run report        # open the HTML report from the last run
```

## Run — real device

Point `TT_DEVICE_URL` at the device. It must be flashed with the current
firmware and reachable on the network.

```bash
# PowerShell
$env:TT_DEVICE_URL="http://token-tracker.local"; npm run test:device

# bash / macOS / Linux
TT_DEVICE_URL=http://token-tracker.local npm run test:device
```

### Safety on real hardware

- CRUD tests (`add`/`delete`) only ever touch a **scratch agent** they create
  themselves at the next free slot — never your existing agents.
- Existing agents are only toggled reversibly (`setActive`/`setEnabled`) and
  restored.
- `global-setup.js` snapshots `GET /state` before the run; `global-teardown.js`
  deletes any leaked scratch agents and restores the originals' `active` /
  `enabled` / `name` / `probeModel` afterward.
- `apiKey` is never exposed by `/state`, so it can't be (and isn't) modified or
  restored — which is exactly why tests never delete a pre-existing keyed agent.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs the suite in **mock mode** on every push to
`main`, every PR, and on manual dispatch. GitHub-hosted runners can't reach a
device on your LAN, so **device mode can't run there** — for that, register a
[self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/actions/hosting-your-own-runners)
on the same network as the ESP32 and set `TT_DEVICE_URL` in that job.

The workflow uploads the Playwright HTML report as a build artifact
(`playwright-report`) for each run.
